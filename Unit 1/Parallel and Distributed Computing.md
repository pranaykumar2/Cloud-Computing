#### Parallel vs. Distributed Computing: Key Distinctions

The terms **"parallel computing"** and **"distributed computing"**, although often used synonymously, have subtle yet crucial differences, as highlighted in the sources. While **parallel computing** involves utilizing multiple processing elements within a single machine or a tightly coupled system, typically featuring homogenous hardware, for increased speed and throughput, **distributed computing** encompasses a broader spectrum, enabling computation across diverse and potentially heterogeneous machines networked together.

**Parallel computing** aims to enhance computational speed and throughput by decomposing tasks into smaller units and processing them simultaneously on multiple processors within a single system or a tightly integrated cluster. In contrast, **distributed computing** is often characterized by looser coupling, where computing elements might reside in geographically distinct locations, potentially featuring varied hardware and software configurations.

#### Elements of Parallel Computing: Architectural Foundations and Programming Paradigms

Parallel computing relies on specialized hardware architectures and programming approaches to effectively harness the power of parallel processing.

##### Hardware Architectures for Parallel Processing: From SISD to MIMD

The evolution of parallel computing has led to the development of diverse hardware architectures designed to exploit parallelism at different levels. The sources categorize these architectures based on the number of instruction and data streams they can process simultaneously.

- **SISD (Single Instruction, Single Data):** Represents the conventional sequential architecture, where one instruction operates on a single data element at a time.
    
- **SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data):** A single instruction acts upon multiple data elements in parallel, commonly found in applications like image processing.
    
- **MISD (Multiple Instruction, Single Data):** This architecture involves multiple instructions operating on the same data element simultaneously, a concept rarely implemented in practice.
    
- **MIMD (Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data):** The most prevalent parallel architecture, allowing multiple instructions to operate on multiple data elements concurrently, offering the highest level of parallelism.
    

##### Approaches to Parallel Programming: Divide, Conquer, and Parallelize

Parallel programming requires specific techniques to decompose programs into smaller, independent units that can be executed concurrently on multiple processors.

- **Data Parallelism:** The same operation is executed on different portions of a dataset simultaneously. This is particularly suitable for tasks like matrix operations or image manipulation where data can be easily partitioned.
    
- **Process Parallelism:** Distinct processes, each with its own data, are run concurrently. This model is well-suited for applications where tasks can be executed independently, such as simulations or web servers.
    
- **Farmer-and-Worker Model:** A master process (farmer) assigns tasks to worker processes for parallel execution. This model is effective for distributing workloads across a network of processors, as in distributed computing environments.
    

##### Levels of Parallelism: Granularity Matters

Parallelism can be achieved at various granularities, impacting program design and performance. The sources describe different levels of parallelism based on the size of code blocks being parallelized.

|Grain Size|Code Item Parallelized By|Example|
|:--|:--|:--|
|Large (Task)|Separate, heavyweight process|Distributing independent simulation runs across multiple nodes.|
|Medium (Control)|Function or procedure|Parallelizing independent loops or function calls within a program.|
|Fine (Data)|Individual data items|Processing elements of an array or pixels in an image in parallel.|
|Very Fine|Instructions|Exploiting instruction-level parallelism within a processor's pipeline.|

##### Laws of Caution: Understanding the Limits of Parallelism

While parallel computing offers substantial performance gains, it's essential to acknowledge its limitations.

- **Amdahl's Law:** The speedup achieved through parallelism is constrained by the portion of the program that cannot be parallelized. This highlights the importance of identifying and optimizing the inherently sequential parts of an application.
    
- **Communication Overhead:** Communication between processing units can introduce significant overhead, potentially negating the performance benefits of parallelism. Efficient communication strategies are crucial for minimizing this overhead.
    
- **Load Balancing:** Distributing work evenly across processors is vital for optimal efficiency. Imbalanced workloads can lead to idle processors, reducing overall performance.
    

#### Elements of Distributed Computing: Building Systems That Span Networks

##### General Concepts and Definitions

A **distributed system** comprises independent computers that collaborate to present users with a unified and coherent system. These systems are characterized by their ability to share resources, openness to different types of computers, concurrent operation of components, scalability to accommodate growth, fault tolerance to handle failures, and transparency to mask the underlying complexities from users.

##### Components of a Distributed System:

- **Computing Nodes:** Independent computers connected via a network, each possessing its own resources (CPU, memory, storage).
    
- **Network Infrastructure:** The communication backbone facilitating data exchange and coordination among nodes.
    
- **Middleware:** A software layer providing services and abstractions to simplify communication and interaction between nodes.
    
- **Applications:** Software programs leveraging the distributed system's capabilities for distributed processing and data management.
    

##### Architectural Styles for Distributed Computing: Blueprints for System Design

Architectural styles define high-level structures and patterns for organizing and coordinating components within a distributed system.

**1. Data-centered architectures:**

- **Repository style:** Centers around a shared data repository accessed by all components. Ensures data integrity and is commonly used in database systems.

**2. Client-server architectures:**

- **Client/server style:** A widely used model where clients request services from dedicated servers, enabling a clear separation of concerns and specialization of functions.

**3. Peer-to-peer architectures:**

- **Peer-to-peer (P2P) style:** Nodes function as both clients and servers, facilitating decentralized communication and resource sharing without relying on a central server.

**4. Layered architectures:**

- **Layered style:** Organizes the system into hierarchical layers, each providing a distinct level of abstraction. Enables modularity and simplifies development and maintenance.

**5. Object-oriented architectures:**

- **Object-oriented style:** Models the system as interacting objects, promoting code reuse and modularity. Facilitates the development of complex distributed systems.

**6. Event-driven architectures:**

- **Event-driven style:** Components communicate through events, allowing asynchronous and loosely coupled interactions. Suitable for systems with unpredictable or dynamic behavior.

##### Models for Interprocess Communication: Bridging the Gap Between Nodes

Interprocess communication (IPC) mechanisms are essential for enabling processes on different nodes to exchange information and coordinate their activities.

- **Message Passing:** Processes communicate by exchanging messages, offering flexibility and loose coupling. Suitable for distributed environments where direct memory sharing is not feasible.
    
- **Shared Memory:** Processes access a common memory region for data exchange, providing high performance but requiring careful synchronization to prevent data corruption. Typically used in tightly coupled systems like multicore processors.
    
- **Remote Procedure Call (RPC):** Clients invoke procedures on remote servers as if they were local, abstracting away the complexities of network communication. Widely used for client-server interactions.
    
- **Distributed Objects:** Objects located on different nodes interact through method invocations, extending object-oriented principles to distributed settings. Offers a higher level of abstraction and modularity compared to RPC.
    

#### Technologies for Distributed Computing: Building Blocks of Distributed Systems

##### 1. Remote Procedure Call (RPC)

RPC enables a client process to invoke a procedure on a remote server as if it were a local procedure, simplifying distributed programming by hiding the underlying network communication details. Examples include:
