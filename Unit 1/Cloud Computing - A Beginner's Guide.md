### Introduction

- **Cloud computing** is a utility-oriented and Internet-centric way of delivering IT services on demand, covering the entire computing stack: from hardware infrastructure packaged as virtual machines to software services like development platforms and distributed applications.

### Historical Developments

- **Distributed Systems:** Clouds are large distributed computing facilities that provide services to third parties on demand. A **distributed system** is a collection of independent computers that appear to its users as a single coherent system. These systems have evolved from mainframes to clusters and grids, contributing to the concept of utility computing and laying the groundwork for cloud computing.
    
- **Virtualization:** Virtualization technologies allow the creation of secure, customizable, and isolated execution environments for running applications, a crucial aspect of cloud infrastructure. It has evolved from process-level to system-level techniques, providing various virtual computation environments.
    
- **Web 2.0:** The emergence of Web 2.0, characterized by interactive and collaborative web applications, marked a significant shift toward user-generated content and online services. Web 2.0 technologies and concepts, like rich internet applications (RIAs) and social networking, have influenced the development of cloud applications and services.
    
- **Service-Oriented Computing:** Service-oriented computing (SOC) focuses on building software systems by composing and integrating reusable services. This approach aligns with the cloud computing model, where services are the primary unit of consumption.
    
- **Utility-Oriented Computing:** Utility computing refers to the delivery of computing resources, like processing power and storage, as a metered service, similar to traditional utilities like electricity and water. This concept is a core principle of cloud computing, allowing users to pay only for the resources they consume.
    

### Computing Platforms

The Cloud Computing Reference Model categorizes cloud computing service offerings into three main types:

- **Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS):** IaaS provides virtualized computing resources, including servers, storage, and networking. Users have control over the operating systems and applications deployed on these virtual resources. Examples include Amazon EC2, S3, Rightscale, and vCloud.
    
- **Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS):** PaaS delivers a platform for developing and deploying applications, including operating systems, programming language runtimes, databases, and middleware. Users can focus on application development without managing the underlying infrastructure. Examples include Google AppEngine, Microsoft Azure, and Force.com.
    
- **Software-as-a-Service (SaaS):** SaaS provides access to software applications hosted and managed by the service provider. Users access these applications over the internet without installing or maintaining them locally. Examples include Google Documents, Facebook, Flickr, and Salesforce.
    

### Technologies

Cloud computing relies on a wide range of technologies, including:

- **Virtualization Technologies:** These enable the creation of virtual machines and other virtualized resources, such as Xen, KVM, VMWare, and Hyper-V.
    
- **Distributed Computing Technologies:** These support the management and coordination of distributed resources, including distributed file systems like Google File System (GFS) and Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), and messaging systems like RabbitMQ and Apache Kafka. The sources do not list specific technologies, but distributed computing technologies in general are a key part of cloud computing.
    
- **Web Technologies:** Web technologies, including HTTP, REST, and web services, facilitate communication and data exchange in cloud environments.
    
- **Programming Languages and Frameworks:** Cloud application development utilizes various programming languages like Java, Python, and Ruby, and frameworks like .NET and Spring, which are not specifically named in the sources but are widely used in cloud application development.
    
- **Data Management Technologies:** Cloud computing leverages various data management technologies, including NoSQL databases like Cassandra and MongoDB, and distributed data processing frameworks like Hadoop and Spark. Some of these are specifically named in the sources.
    
- **Security Technologies:** Security technologies like firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and encryption are essential for securing cloud environments. The sources mention these general areas of security technologies.
    

This interconnected web of technologies enables cloud computing to offer scalable, on-demand access to IT resources and services.
